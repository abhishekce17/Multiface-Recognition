# Multiface-Recognition
In this project we are trying to make a live multiple face recognition system
For this we have used openCV and ML concept in python
to run this project you need required packages and libraries which are face_recognition and openCV2
You have to make a folder name as Face Models where you will store person images for recognition and comparison
Person images should be rename as per their name so that while recognition their name will show on the screen
when a face in image is found and recognise with given images in the folder a box will appear on covering whole face and on top of that their name will show 
Shown name will be image name saved in Face Models folder
